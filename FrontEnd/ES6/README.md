## ECMAScript 6

ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification created to standardize JavaScript.

The Sixth Edition, initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, iterators and for/of loops, generators, arrow functions, binary data, typed arrays, collections (maps, sets and weak maps), promises, number and math enhancements, reflection, and proxies.

In other words, ES6 is a superset of JavaScript (ES5). The reason that ES6 became so popular is that it introduced new conventions and OOP concepts such as classes.
