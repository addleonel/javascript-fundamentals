// Rules for Naming Variables
// --------------------------
// - The first character must be a letter or an underscore (_). 
//   You can't use a number as the first character.

// - The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or the underscore. 
//   You can't use any other characters, including spaces, symbols, and punctuation marks.

// - As with the rest of JavaScript, variable names are case sensitive. 
//   That is, a variable named Interest_Rate is treated as an entirely different variable than one named interest_rate.

// - There's no limit to the length of the variable name.

// - You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name. 
//   All programming languages have a supply of words that are used internally by the language and 
//   that can't be used for variable names because doing so would cause confusion (or worse). 
//   Note, too, that JavaScript also has many keywords that should be avoided as well.

// Case Styles: Camel, Pascal, Snake, and Kebab Case
// -------------------------------------------------

// Using snake_case
var string_one = "this is a string";
var string_two = "this is a string";

var positive_number = 23.23;
var negative_number = -121.32;

var from_peru = true;
var from_france = false;

var fibonaci_number = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21];

var my_object = {
	"username": "anybody",
	"score": 14.3,
	"proffesional":true, 
}

// Using camelCase
var varVariable = "this is a string";
 
let letVaribale = "this is a string";

const piValue = 3.14159265358979;

// Using PascalCase
let NameAge = "Leonel21";

// Using kebab-case
let top-book = "Ubuntu"


// This is a simple comment
/*
	This is a extend comment
*/


// RUN

// Using console.log
console.log("this is a string");
console.log([1, 2, 3,4]);
console.log(my_object);
